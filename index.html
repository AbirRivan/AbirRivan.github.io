                      <h3>Abir Bin Yousuf</h3>
                      <h4>Computer Engineer| Gamer| Football Player</h4>
                      <p class="pt-4">I am from Chattogram and I was born there on 2nd September, 1997. I have an elder brother and a younger sister and they are still studying. My father is a businessman and my mother is a housewife. I graduated recently and I am trying to build up some skills and building this website is a part of it. I wish to become a Database Engineer as the concept of database management amused me so much while doing a course named Database Systems. I would also love to be an instructor someday as I always loved the way my faculties in BRAC University conducted their lectures. I want to learn a lot from my superiors and widen my horizon as much as I can. I always try to be punctual with the tasks given to me and try to finish it within given time. I think I am a team-player and I am capable of leading a team if needed.    
                      </p>
                      <p>I love playing football and I usually play as a Left Back for my team. I used to play a lot when I was in college but after going to Dhaka, I did not get enough chance or time to continue playing as much. I was quite adequate in football and I have a lot of memories that I still cherish to this day. After moving to Dhaka, I decided to start playing FPS(First Person Shooting) games with my friends. I played the multiplayer game called Rainbow Six Siege for almost 2 years(2018-2020). After that I started playing another multiplayer game named Valorant and I still enjoy playing this game in my free time. Whether it is football or fps games, one thing is constant that I love winning. It is not important to me if I score goals or get the mvp in a match; The most important thing for me is to make sure that my team gets the win. Mybe that is why I play as a support player when no one else would.</p>
                      <p>Moreover, I love travelling with my friends a lot. I have never gone outside Bangladesh and the reason behind is that I want to cover all the beautiful places inside Bangladesh first. I also love cycling and I go to rides at least once or twice a month if I am free.</p> 
                      <p>Apart from these hobbies, I am fairly fluent in English and can also maintain a conversation in Hindi. I have sufficient knowledge on programming languages like JAVA, Python, Php and Mysql. I have done some group projects over the time I was in my university and these projects are shown in the Projects section of this webpage. There are also some images of the places I visited for last 5years in the Photo Gallery section and I would love it if you check them out. Thanks for visiting my website.</p>

                              <p class="lifestages">I started my journey at BRAC University on 8th January, 2016. At first, it was difficult to cope up with the new environment away from my family but gradually, it got better with the help of some friends. It was a great journey as the faculties there were very good and helpful. I got some of the best teachers of my life in BRAC and I will always be grateful to them. After 5 years, I graduated from BRAC University on 15th January,2021 completing my Major in Computer Science & Engineering and Minor in BBA.<br>

My college life can be summarized in two words: Football and Table tennis. I got obsessed with football and played almost every single day. I mostly joined the practical classes and was avoiding theory classes for playing football. Maybe that is why I got to know so little about the faculties there. However, the overall environment of my college was great and I would love to lead this portion of my life again and again. I attended my Higher Secondary Certificate(HSC) examination from this college and obtained a fairly good ressult.<br>
